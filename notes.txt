1. Register you app in Firebase and set up all platforms. Android and iOS.
2. For setting Android platform, make sure you have SHA key based on the type of your APK (Debug or Release).
To print SHA key of your apk, type "keytool -printcert -jarfile path-of-your-apk.apk" in console.
3. After setting up Android and iOS platforms, also set up Web App as an Platform (to get idToken and serverAuthToken).
4. For iOS (IMPORTANT) add a variable after adding google-plus plugin in the last of package.json.
"cordova": {
    "plugins": {
      "cordova-plugin-googleplus": {
        "REVERSED_CLIENT_ID": "<app id from manifest>"
      }
    }
  }
5. For Android, no variable is required but make sure to check SHA key.
6. After that, add google plus packages specific to cordova or capacitor.
(For capacitor, make sure to do ionic cap sync after adding package)
7. After adding package, add google plus dependency in module.
8. In the component, use following code
this.googlePlus.login(
    {
        webClientId: '<webClientID>',
        offline: true,
        scopes: 'profile email'
    }
)
9. You will get web client id in Google Console API site, there because of registering Firebase app.
Client IDs will automatically get created in Google API Console.
10. Same web client id will be used in back end servers to get the idToken authorized from backend.
